Swagger-Net
=========

[![AppVeyor](https://img.shields.io/appveyor/ci/heldersepu/swagger-net.svg)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/heldersepu/swagger-net)


Seamlessly add [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui(3.x) to provide a rich discovery, documentation and playground experience to your API consumers.

In addition to its Swagger generator, the [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) is embedded and will automatically serve up once Swagger-Net is installed. This means you can complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their integration efforts. 

**Swagger-Net Features:**

* Latest and greatest of all dependencies
* High UnitTest CodeCoverage (99%)
* Auto-generated [Swagger 2.0](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/2.0.md)
* Seamless integration of swagger-ui (3.x)
* Reflection-based Schema generation for describing API types
* Extensibility hooks for customizing the generated Swagger doc and swagger-ui
* Out-of-the-box support for Xml comments

And that's not all ...

Once your Web API can describe itself, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more details.
