Swagger-Net
=========

Seamlessly adds a [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) to WebApi projects! Combines ApiExplorer and Swagger/swagger-ui(3.x) to provide a rich discovery, documentation and playground experience to your API consumers.

In addition to its Swagger generator, Swagger-Net also contains an embedded version of [swagger-ui](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) which it will automatically serve up once Swagger-Net is installed. This means you can complement your API with a slick discovery UI to assist consumers with their integration efforts. Best of all, it requires minimal coding and maintenance, allowing you to focus on building an awesome API!

And that's not all ...

Once you have a Web API that can describe itself in Swagger, you've opened the treasure chest of Swagger-based tools including a client generator that can be targeted to a wide range of popular platforms. See [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) for more details.
